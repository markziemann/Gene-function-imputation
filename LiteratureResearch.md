# Literature Research 

The candidate will perform a search of the recent literature (2016-current) on the use of machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence technology in inferring genetic networks and gene functions from coexpression and other biological data.

The candidate will provide a 2-3 page document summarising what they have found and how it could be applied to generate knowledge from large scale gene expression data such as ARCHS4 and DEE2.
